%
%I am a passionate and an experienced data analyst accustomed to dealing 
%with large-scale datasets to answer intriguing and challenging questions in the context of physics.
%I have been a member of a highly competitive and international  collaboration of scientists for about 10 years at CERN,
%lead and contributed to a number of peer-reviewed publications searching for new physics, 
%scrutinized my peers' work, and mentored students with different backgrounds.
%Having developed and perfected a wide range of skills in data analysis, 
%programming, leadership and communication I am looking forward to tackle 
%interesting questions outside of physics as a full-time Data Scientist.
